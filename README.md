# CS-Capstone-Campus-Safety-App

A mobile application built with **React Native** to enhance campus safety for students, staff, and visitors at **Drake University**. The app provides quick access to emergency resources, allows for safety reporting, and connects to a live backend hosted on **AWS** with an SQL database. Much of the code in this repository is built by ExpoGo, our sandbox client. The actual features we developed are all located inside the `ReactApp` folder. We also developed code to support our SQL server and to style our Javascript.

## ðŸš¨ Features

-  **Register and Login**
  Create an account in our user database and sign in.

-  **Emergency Help Button**  
  Instantly notifies campus Public Safety in the event of an emergency.

- **Safety Timer**  
  Set a timer when walking alone. If not canceled before the countdown ends, Public Safety is automatically notified.

  Submit reports either officially (with your identity) or anonymously. Reports are pushed to our database backend via an API.

- **Chaperone Request**  
  Request a campus escort to walk you safely to your destination. This feature is currently in a demo state as we are not currently communicating directly with Public Safety
